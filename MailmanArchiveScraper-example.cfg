# Remove email addresses or not? 
# Either 1 or 0 (for yes or no).

# eg, http://lists.mydomain.com/mailman/listinfo/list-name

# Should quoted text be stripped out of messages?
# If so, how many levels?

# How many hours back should we look back for new messages when the script runs?
# Set it to more than however often the script is run via cron.

# Set to 0 to fetch ALL messages. Every single page in the archive. All of them.

# Should we output extra data while the script is running?
# Probably set it to True if you're running on the command line.
